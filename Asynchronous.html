<h1>Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>

<script>
       /*

         - synchronous i mean all the instructions
           are executed one after the other line by line
           just in the order that appear in the code

         - set Asynchronous Code and in order to do that
           we're going to use setTimeOut function which it Basically
           to set timer and that will then allow us to write code
           that should be executed later that's a asynchronous Js


           - SetTimeout function is a function that we can pass a callback function
             and also the time
             second arg is for how long want timer to run in miliseconds
             we put 2000 mSeconds and after 2 sec the code will run


             //////////////////////////////////////////////////////
              ** How Asynchronous Js Work Behind The Scene


        */
       /*
       This is Synchronous Code which simply means
       one statement is parsed after the other
       line by line
       when first function executed
       logs hey there to the console
       call the second function which prints
       How Are You Doing and then finally
       the end is logged to the console
       so one instruction after the other
       in a synchronous way

       **** Synchronous Example *****
        const second = () => {
        console.log('How are YOu Doing ?');
        };
        const First = () => {
         console.log('Hey There!');
         second();
         console.log('The End')
         };
         First();

         **** Asynchronous Example
        const second = () => {
        setTimeout( () => {
        console.log('Async Hey There! ?');

        },2000)
        };
        const First = () => {
        console.log('Hey There!');
        second();
        console.log('The End')
        };
        First();

        So Again first thing logged to the console
        Hey There !
        and second() function call setTimeout function
        which basically Timer that will execute
        the call back function that passed into it
        after 2 seconds
        how ever this will not make the code stop 2 seconds
        but instead the function will returns goes back
        to the first Function and loges 'The End' to the console
        then after the 2 seconds passed 'Async Hey There!'
        logs to the console
        why the code move on insted of waiting the timer to finish

        - allow asynchronous function to ruu in the background
        - we pass in callbacks that run once the function
          has finished its work.
        - move on immediately:Non-Blocking!


     so the event loop is part of the bigger picture
     of what happens behind the scene
     when we call function and handle events
     like Dom-Events

          This is called callback-Hell
          callback inside call back inside callback
          so this is messy
          so that's way in Es6 Something called promises
          introduced with it you can avoid all theses callback
          functions here and have and nice and cleaner syntax
          and using Asynchronous like we have here in our Example
